Password Generator

A password is generated based on the answer the user provides when prompted

When user clicks "Generate Password" they will be asked for character length, if user picks a number outside of 8 - 128 characters they will be asked again to select a character length. this will continue till they provide a valid number

The prompt then will ask the user in sequence if they want to include numbers, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If none of the parameters have been accepted the program will ask the user to select at least one parameter and it will loop back to the beginning. 

after everything has inputed, the generated password will appear in the password box
